        "The analysis relies on the concept of conservation of energy.  A motor will push back plunger (performing work), compressing a spring (storing potential energy).  When the plunger is released, the spring propels the plunger forward (converting to kinetic energy).  At the end of it's stroke, the plunger strikes the ball, transferring some kinetic energy to it.  The ball then flies up, it's energy transitioning smoothly to gravitational potential energy as it rises."
